# HCKM UI/UX Design Process & Brief
## Hackers.Market - Decentralized P2P RWA Trading Platform

## 1. Project Overview

**HCKM (Hackers.Market)** is a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace that enables secure trading of Real World Assets (RWA) through smart contract-based escrow services and integrated crypto payment gateways powered by 1inch.

### 1.1 Core Concept

The platform functions as a "decentralized eBay" or "Kleinanzeigen.de" with the following key differentiators:
- Smart contract-based automated escrow system
- DID-based KYC verification
- Cross-chain crypto payment gateway
- No tokenization of RWAs required
- Transparent and verifiable transactions

### 1.2 Target Categories

The platform supports three main asset categories:
1. **IRL Physical Goods** (e.g., second-hand electronics, hardware, merchandise)
2. **On-Chain Assets** (e.g., NFTs, tradable digital assets)
3. **Traditional Digital Products** (e.g., gift cards, redeemable codes)
